# College Results; Post-MIT and Thoughts on Caltech

My early acceptance into Caltech has made me significantly calmer when opening my college decisions. I was never particularity enthusiastic about schools like Purdue, UIUC, and UMichigan, but I'm certain I would have taken my MIT rejection much worse had I not been accepted into Caltech. 

This brings my current list of rejected schools to 2: UChicago and MIT. I'd say that considering I've been accepted to 6/8 schools so far, including some notable ones, I have a decent chance at getting more acceptances when UC and Ivy day comes up. However, I don't believe that I'll be accepting a school other than Caltech.

Caltech is significantly different from some of the other schools that I applied to in the sense that it leans towards academia more than anyone else. I'm extremely torn whether I want to enter industry or academia related work, but either way I feel like there's some risk to Caltech funneling me into one mentality just by the nature in which the classes are built. The computer science program at Caltech specifically isn't extremely famous, but it is the most popular track, which I wonder how research will faire in that field. Allegedly, the CS department has plans to expand its funding, and I'm excited to see what research opportunities will be available. I'm not sure how I feel about research at NASA, but its good that I know that non-industry internships are always available there.

Whatever the case, college isn't supposed to be the "end-all-be-all", and I hope it all works out in the end.
