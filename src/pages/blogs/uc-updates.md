# UC College Updates

TL;DR Waitlisted at UC Berkeley, accepted to all other UCs (UCLA, Irvine, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Davis).

Its not brilliant news, since Berkeley was most likely the only one I would have considered over Caltech, and I was accepted to everything *but* Berkeley. I heard from peers that UCLA and UC Berkeley are dichotomies: You either get into one or the other. Unfortunately, that did become true, but it *does* have one benefit: my application essays were good enough for many of the UCs, so they may be good enough for the 6 colleges I have left.

Honestly I just wanted that "6/6 UCs accepted".

Two of my friends who were very stressed about their rejected on their UCs were accepted into UC Berkeley though, so cheers to them!

USC and Carnegie Mellon will be released in the following two days, and I hope for the best.
