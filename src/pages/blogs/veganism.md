# The Beginning

This will be updated once in a while whenever I decide to have a philosophical crisis. Over the course of the past year, the topic of veganism has been of greater interest to me, and I wanted to organize my own thoughts on the subject.

Predicate assumptions of my current beliefs (2022-03-18)
- I have strong beliefs on existentialism, and a positive opinion on utilitarianism
- All of my positions will be based on the importance of **philosophical consistency**
- I don't feel any moral disgust over the consumption of meat
- I'm very much stuck in performative activism in terms of environmental regulations
- Environmental concerns *for humans* are the primary reason I'm considering this, not animals
- I'm taking it as a given that veganism is good for the environment

I'll be going over several points for/against veganism and trying to justify my positions on each.  

# "The Dividing Line" doesn't exist

To make this point, I need to diverge temporarily away from the main point to talk about something else entirely: Trans rights.

## Trans Rights: "What is the definition of a ___"?

I'm for trans rights. One of the most common essentialist rhetoric that I see from transphobes is that there is a biological set definition that delineates between a woman and a man, and at this point I've heard it so much that I have a set response for it: *What exactly is that dividing line?*

Common responses and my refutations to them:

- "Chromosomes": We know cis women with XY chromosomes, or cis men with XXY chromosomes (Klienfelter's syndrome). Additionally, since we didn't even know chromosomes existed until 1882, we had to have some definition before 1882 that didn't use chromosomes.
- "Ability to give birth": This would make infertile women be a cis man
- "Genitals": This would imply those without genitals (MRKH Syndrom) wouldn't have a gender. Or sex, for that matter.
- "These are all exceptions": In that case, I can say that people with green eyes are "exceptions" and "don't actually exist", because there are less people with green eyes than trans people. This also doesn't answer why one would see the other exceptions as valid, but not this.

The point is there *is* no dividing line. I support the definition of "a woman" as "someone who identifies as one". This *does* create a proper diving line, but says nothing about the *qualities* of someone who would identifies as a woman, which is why I don't like social construct of gender as a whole. But this definition serves better than the biological or essentialist definitions used by transphobes today.

## Back to the dividing line on veganism

So why did I talk about trans rights? Well to be philosophical consistent, I have to ask the same question about any groups of people; its the same line of reasoning I can use to justify that very basic concept of "not being racist" or "not being sexist". Of course I don't *need* that much thought to say that, but I think it serves as a useful tool.

But I've never asked that *outside* of the window of just human beings. Which makes me ask...

## What is the dividing line between humans and animals?

To expand on that question, why should that dividing line be able to justify mistreatment of animals? What makes humans so much inherently better that allows me to not consider the lives of animals have enough value?

Reasons I gave to myself, and my problems with them:

- "Out of a necessity to live": I can live perfectly fine without meat. This is a different story if I'm in a region where I'm starving, but this is definitely not a valid reason for *me*.
- "Intelligence": I still ascribe value to those that are human vegetables, or brain dead, or those that are profoundly mentally disabled to the point where they would probably have less intelligence than the average dog or pig. Speaking of dogs and pigs, I eat pigs but not dogs, which makes this point weird since they have similar levels of intelligence.
- "Capacity to feel pain": Again, this makes it more justified for me to eat a human vegetable than a pig. Also, the average person wouldn't eat their pet, even after they die painlessly.
- "Its just how it is, culturally and historically": You could justify lots of things this way: slavery, misogyny, war, etc. I've never been a fan of conservatism for this reason.
- "We're genetically superior; its just Darwin at play": We've justified misogyny through this exact principle. This rhetoric is just a more milder form of race realism to me, just with species.

In short, I can't seem to find that philosophically consistent dividing line, nor can I justify that difference. But in thinking about the first point, I found a bigger issue with my analysis.

## The dividing line isn't about humans vs animals, its about humans taste vs animals

I'm not starving here. I can live without them. The choice I'm making here isn't my own survival compared to an animals, its my choice for pleasure on my taste buds compared to an animal's life. And yes, I'm taking it as a given that animals taste good, which is why I'm debating this at all in the first place.

Putting it like that, it makes the points I've made almost worthless. No, I don't value animal lives over human pleasure. **If someone wanted to kill a pig because they like the sounds it makes**, I would be repulsed. But really, what's the difference between doing that for taste and sound?

## This begs the question: What's the dividing line between animals and plants?

This is where I'm stuck for now. This feels like it leads to an infinite regress, but then again, as I established in the last point, it doesn't really matter when it comes to the topic of veganism.

Moreover, we grow plants, feed them to animals, then we eat the animals. Vegans just eat the plants. In that sense, we are causing the exact same amount of harm to plants, so this is a non-issue to me.
